# Email Provider Implementation Improvements

This document tracks potential improvements to the email provider implementation in the Cloudflare Email Server. Each item has a checkbox that can be marked when the improvement is implemented.

## Architecture & Design

- [ ] Add a registry pattern to the `EmailProviderFactory` for better extensibility
- [ ] Extract common functionality into shared utilities
- [ ] Create an email templating system for both providers
- [ ] Implement a more robust error handling strategy with specific error types
- [ ] Add a metrics collection system for monitoring

## Email Service Improvements

### Architecture & Integration

- [ ] Implement provider switching during runtime based on conditions (fallback strategy)
- [ ] Add provider health checks for better reliability
- [ ] Create a provider manager to handle multiple providers
- [ ] Implement a circuit breaker pattern for failing providers

### Lifecycle Management

- [ ] Improve initialization handling between worker and non-worker environments
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown and connection management
- [ ] Add reconnection logic for dropped connections
- [ ] Create a connection pool for high-volume scenarios
- [ ] Implement provider warm-up strategy for better cold start performance

### Error Handling & Validation

- [ ] Enhance request validation with more detailed error messages
- [ ] Implement domain-specific error types for better error handling
- [ ] Add validation for recipient email addresses
- [ ] Implement content validation and sanitization
- [ ] Create an error classification system for analytics

### Monitoring & Performance

- [ ] Add detailed timing metrics for different email sending phases
- [ ] Implement success rate tracking by provider
- [ ] Create dashboard endpoints for monitoring
- [ ] Add throttling capabilities to avoid rate limits
- [ ] Implement background sending for non-critical emails

## Interface Improvements

- [ ] Add support for email attachments
- [ ] Support HTML content in all providers
- [ ] Add CC and BCC support
- [ ] Support custom email headers
- [ ] Add priority/importance flag support
